## MVVM & Clean Architecture In Android
Hi, I’m [Mukul Jangir](https://mukuljangir372.github.io), an android developer having experience in building kotlin and java android applications. I’ve been worked on over 25+ apps and contributing to multiple opensource projects. 
In this article, we are going to understand the MVVM and clean architecture.

#### What is MVVM Architecture?

MVVM stands for `Model-View-View-Model`. In MVVM architecture, ViewModel doesn’t know about view. View simply communicate to model/state provided by viewmodel to render the ui components. It removes the tight coupling between view and viewmodel. 

**Model** - Model is the data/state or business logic. It consists a data model or state model or local/network sources.\
**View** - View is the actual UI which renders using model provided by viewmodel.\
**ViewModel** - As name suggests, It acts like a bridge between view and model. It doesn’t have any knowledge about the view. It communicate with the model and expose a state.

#### What is Clean Architecture?

As the userbase grows, the size of application grows. It becomes very hard and complex to maintain the big size projects  for the developers without further divide into smaller layers. Big size projects also comes with the problems associated with testing, scalability, reusability. To tackle with these problems and to scale the product, clean architecture comes in full frame. 
In Clean architecture, a large codebase divides into multiple smaller layers or modules. For instance, a network or local database business logic separated into `data-local` and `data-network` . And further divides into `api` , `impl` and `test` layers. 

For more details, you should have a look at [Primer-Android](https://github.com/Mukuljangir372/Primer-Android) github project. 

#### Why MVVM Architecture?

When it comes to calculate the advantages and disadvantages of using mvvm. You should first have a look at other architecture like `MVP` or `MVC` or `MVI`.  At reality page, every architecture pattern have it’s own advantages and disadvantages.

1. `MVP` and `MVC` are very bad in handling orientation changes smoothly like `MVVM` does. 
2. In `MVP` and `MVC` , a controller and presenter tighly bounded with view/ui unlike `MVVM`.
3. In `MVVM`, you don’t have to write multiple interfaces for the View communication like `MVP` or `MVC` does.
4. In `MVI`, race conditions or parallel state mutations are one of the terrible issues that `MVVM` solves.
5. In `MVVM`, we need to write multiple state/observables for each and every ui component. This is the disadvantage of `MVVM` that `MVI` solves but `MVI` comes with multiple costs that you don’t handle. 

#### Before Using ViewModel

Before writing/using your viewmodel, you should consider these points -

#### Exposing the State

In ViewModel, you should be very carefull while exposing any data/property outside the viewmodel. It helps the reducing the bugs and also to gain the confidence in viewmodel state/property mutation. You should only expose the uistate or data state without exposing the business logic or something else. 

#### Context In ViewModel

You should avoid using `Context` or any android related api or any ui releated components in your viewmodel. It makes the viewmodel hard to test. Also it increase the risk of memory leaks.

#### Using Strings In ViewModel

Using `Context` or any android releated api in your viewmodel is a bad practise. Rather than using context to get string in your viewmodel, you should consider to pass only string id resource like `R.string.message` to your ui-state in your viewmodel and fetch the strings from resId in your activity/fragment.

#### Exposing The Functions

You should consider to use `visiblity modifiers` in almost everywhere in your code to gain `encapsulation`. Make sure you only expose those functions that don’t expose the entire logic or business logic of your viewmodel.  You should consider the expose only those functions that only change the state for the view.

At last, let’s write our viewmodel.

```kotlin
class MainViewModel: ViewModel() {
    sealed interface Model
    data class State(
        val uiLoading: UiLoading, 
        val uiMessage: UiMessage,
        val navigation: Navigation
    ) : Model {
        companion object {
            val EMPTY = State(
                uiLoading = UiLoading.None,
                uiMessage = UiMessage.None,
                navigation = Navigation.None
            )
        }

    }

    sealed interface UiMessage {
        data class Toast(val msg: String) : UiMessage
        object None : UiMessage
    }

    sealed interface UiLoading {
        object Full: UiLoading
        object None: UiLoading
    }

    sealed interface Navigation {
        object Back : Navigation
        object None : Navigation
    }

    sealed interface Terminate {
        object None : Terminate
        object ClearState : Terminate
    }

    private val uiLoading = MutableStateFlow<UiLoading>(UiLoading.None)
    private val uiMessage = MutableStateFlow<UiMessage>(UiMessage.None)
    private val navigation = MutableStateFlow<Navigation>(Navigation.None)
    private val terminate = MutableStateFlow<Terminate>(Terminate.None)

    val state = combine(
        uiLoading,
        uiMessage,
        navigation,
    ) { uiLoading, uiMessage, nav ->
        State(
            uiLoading = uiLoading,
            uiMessage = uiMessage,
            navigation = nav
        )
    }.stateIn(
        scope = viewModelScope,
        started = SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000L),
        initialValue = State.EMPTY
    )
    
    fun onLoadingChange(_loading: UiLoading) {
        uiLoading.value = _loading
    }
    
    fun onNavigationChange(_navigation: Navigation) {
        navigation.value = _navigation
    }
    
    fun onUiMessageChange(_uiMessage: UiMessage) {
        uiMessage.value = _uiMessage
    }

}
```

#### Before using the ViewModel State

You should consider these points as well before consuming the exposed state in your activity/fragment/view.

#### Lifecycle Aware Api

Using lifecycle aware components in your code will increase the stability of your application. Here, the consumption of state/flow should be done inside lifecycle aware coroutine scope that cancel the collections of data when view destroys/detach. 

#### Recomposition or Re-rending the UI

While updating the ui, you should consider to check the state or state-property if it have been changed or not. Because generally, viewmodel state holds multiple ui state, if one state-property changes, it can render the full ui as well. So what is the solution of this issue. Here is it.

```kotlin
fun <T> Flow<T>.ifChanged(): Flow<T> {
    return ifChanged { it }
}

fun <T, R> Flow<T>.ifChanged(transform: (T) -> R): Flow<T> {
    var observedValueOnce = false
    var lastMappedValue: R? = null

    return filter { value ->
        val mapped = transform.invoke(value)
        if (!observedValueOnce || mapped != lastMappedValue) {
            lastMappedValue = mapped
            observedValueOnce = true
            true
        } else {
            false
        }
    }
}

//How to use?
flow.map { it.color }
    .ifChanged()
    .collect { color ->
          //collect only when color is different from previous color
    }
```

#### Let’s consume the State

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private var _binding: ActivityMainBinding? = null
    private val binding: ActivityMainBinding get() = _binding!!
    
    //inject viewModel before use

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        initViews()
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        _binding = null
    }

    private fun initViews() {
        //inside lifecycleScope
        scope.launch { 
          viewModel.state.map { it.fruitName }
                   .ifChanged() 
                   .collect { fruitName ->
                       renderFruit()
                   }
         }
    }
}
```
